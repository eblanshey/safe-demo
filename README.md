# SAFE API Demo App

This is a demo app built with React that shows how you can use the SAFE API React helpers to easily
create an app that interacts with the SAFE Network. [Read the documentation](https://github.com/eblanshey/safe-api)
to learn how to use the API.

It shows how to signup and log in, get and put objects/collections, retrieve authentication data, and more.

To run locally, clone the repo, install NPM dependencies (`npm install`), and run `npm start` to start the dev server. Then visit your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.
